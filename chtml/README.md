# CHTML

> A component System thatâ€™s as Simple and Universal as HTML Itself!

CHTML is a framework for designing UI components at markup level. It is aptly named as it entirely shifts the concept of UI componentization from JavaScript classes to plain HTML. And this is an important change!

## Design and Architectural Concepts

CHTML is designed to bring order to your UI and your team!

### Designers

* Use Semantic Markup: Form **UI models** \(component/node relationships\) at markup level - using a role-based markup pattern.
* Interact with an App: Instruct directives over some application **API** \(data/state and methods\) and orchestrate any behaviour - all within component markup.
* Reuse; reuse: Define once and use everywhere - in whole or in part - using imports and CHTML's unmatched composability.

### Developers

* Traverse the UI: Access **UI models** \(component/node trees\) programatically; think less of the DOM tree and more of the Component tree.
* Or forget about the UI: Build an entire app independently of the UI and simply expose some **API** \(data/state and methods\) for the UI to consume.

## Zero Learning Curve! Vertical Takeoff!

Since CHTML is built on standard HTML and JavaScript, there is practically nothing new to learn! The only difficult thing might be: you'll have to unlearn the old way - all the template syntax and the "HTML in JS" practice!
